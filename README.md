# Tikua

Isomorphic JS package designed for seamless integration with any visual library on both Browser and Terminal environments. The SDK supports any provider or network, offering complete configurability to define applications with multiple chain support. It adapts to specific configurations and provides warnings for any unsupported provider chains.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -s @doiim/tikua
```

## Usage

You can jump directly to our [Examples](https://github.com/doiim/tikua/tree/master/examples) folder to see how to implement Tikua on multiple platforms. Additionally, you can find a detailed description of the Tikua Class and its functions.

### Tikua SDK

The `Tikua` class is the main entry point for this SDK. It is instantiated with the following parameters:

- `abi`: The ABI of your dapp. [Human Readable ABI definition](https://abitype.dev/api/human)
- `provider (optional)`: The EIP1193 provider to use. Needed for Input calls.
- `appAddress (optional)`: The address of your application deployed. Needed for Input calls.
- `appEndpoint (optional)`: The endpoint of your dapp. Needed for Inspect and Notices

- `waitBlocks`: The amount of blocks to wait before considering an input sent. Defaults to 1.
- `signerAddress (optional)`: The account to sign transactions. Defaults to the first account returned from `getAddresses()` on the provider.

```ts
const abi = [
  "function attackDragon(uint256 dragonId, string weapon)",
  "function dragonStatus(uint256 dragonId) returns (uint256)",
];
const tikua = new Tikua({
  appAddress: "0x0123123",

## Backend

For the backend we use a framework call [Deroll](https://github.com/tuler/deroll). It uses a Typescript backend structure centralized in an ABI protocol same way Tikua. You can start from an example implementation on our [Examples](https://github.com/doiim/tikua/tree/master/examples) folder. There you will find a project using Deroll framework to talk with a frontend using Tikua. Deroll uses ABI for encode and decode function calls/responses, accelerating your development in multiple aspects. Both Deroll and Tikua are based on [Viem](https://viem.sh/) library for encode and decode ABI calls.

In case you don't want to use Deroll. You can easily decode Tikua inputs using View with the following syntax:

### Using payload decoding on Advance

```ts
import { decodeFunctionData, parseAbi } from "viem";

// define application ABI
const abi = parseAbi(["function attackDragon(uint256 dragonId)"]);

const handleAdvance: AdvanceRequestHandler = async (data) => {
  // functionName will be the name of the function called on Tikua.
  // args are the arguments passed using Tikua
  const { functionName, args } = decodeFunctionData({
    abi,
    data: data.payload,
  });
  // Execute calls you want based on functionName and args passed.
  return "accept";
};
```

### Using payload decoding on Inspect

```ts
import { decodeFunctionData, parseAbi, hexToString } from "viem";

// define application ABI
const abi = parseAbi(["function heroLife(address)"]);

const handleInspect: InspectRequestHandler = async (data) => {
  // functionName will be the name of the function called on Tikua.
  // args are the arguments passed using Tikua
  const { functionName, args } = decodeFunctionData({
    abi,
    data: hexToString(data.payload) as `0x${string}`,
  });
  // Execute calls you want based on functionName and args passed.
};
```
